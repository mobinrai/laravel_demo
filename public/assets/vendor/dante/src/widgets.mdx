# Widgets


Widgets are just react components that you can use to render custom content on your component. Note that all Dante's features are composed as components.

Widgets are contained in an array that contain a configuration object

the config options are:

## Options

+ **block**: the class of the React.Component.
+ **editable**: boolean, this configures if the component will be editable or not.
+ **renderable**: boolean, this configures if the component is renderable
+ **breakOnContinuous**: boolean, same as continuousBlock but for widgets.
+ **handleEnterWithText**: function, this handles the behaviour when you hit ENTER on the component and text is present.
handleEnterWihoutText: function, this handles the behaviour when you hit ENTER on the component and no text is present.
+ **selectedFn**: function, this handles the behaviour when component is focused
+ **selected_class**: string, this configures which class will be added when component is focused
+ **wrapper_class**: string, this configures the default class that will wrapp the component
+ **options**: Object, this are custom options that will be stored in your component for later use.
+ **widget_options**: Object, this are custom options that will operate as a blockProps, this are volatile options and will not be stored in your content but will be accesible in the editor's context. 

---------------

Widgets can interoperate with tooltips or other widgets. For example the Add Button loads the widgets that have a "displayOnInlineTooltip" option on widget_options. That basically is a custom option that can be read from any component since the widget context have access to Dante's context.

-------------------

## default

By default Dante2 has the image, link embed & video embed activated out of the box. If "Add Button" is configured (it is by default), those widgets will be displayed when the button is clicked.  

<Playground>
  <Dante content={null} />
</Playground>

## empty widgets 

Also you can empty the list of widgets:

<Playground>
  <Dante content={null} widgets={[]}/>
</Playground>

Or configure those one by one:

<Playground>
  <Dante content={null} widgets={[ImageBlockConfig()]}  
  />
</Playground>


# Embed & Extract

Embed and Video widgets uses open framely you can override this by using your own account of iframely or use another oembed provider like embedly.

<Playground>
